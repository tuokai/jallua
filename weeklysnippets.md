## Week 45

Timo:

- Chose Angular 2 as the client implementation technology due to it being totally novel to me
- Learned a lot about JavaScript modules
- Managed to shrink the Angular 2 Hello World example from 1.4MB to 0.5MB (before minimization) in a rather reasonable workflow
- Next week: learn about Angular 2 itself, start working on actual client functionality
